Cheap products are awesome. But what's even better than cheap products? Free products.
That's why we decided to make _The WishWiz_, a Chrome extension that filters and displays all free products on the marketplace Wish.
Be free to use our code, have fun with it :)

------------------------------------------------------------

## Moving Forward:

- Implement Button "show more", show even more free productsPerRow
- Products must be opened in a new tab by now, otherwise site reloads and free products are gone
- If user scrolls to far down, Wish reorders the products, free ones not on top anymore

-------------------------------------------------------------

## Features:

- Filter free products and show them on top of ProductGrid__ProductGridRow
- Choose a max price for filter, enables the user to not only see the free products
- Tooltips and progress bar for UX

------------------------------------------------------------

## Limits for developers:

- It is not possible to automatically open the extension dialog when "Wish" is loaded.
--> Google doesn't allow this:
